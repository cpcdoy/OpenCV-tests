# OpenCV-tests

This repository contains little pocs (that may still need some tweaking) using the OpenCV library.

It mainly implements text skew correction via 2 methods: -Bounding Box and morphological operator (erosion)
                                                         -Discrete Fourier Transform and Hough Transform (needs tweaking because of approximation errors on the lines from the frequency domain)
